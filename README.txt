The Tropical Cyclone Risk Model (TCRM) is a computational tool developed by Geoscience
Australia (GA) for estimating the wind hazard from tropical cyclones. 

TCRM is free and open-source and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 and
above (refer to the file COPYING.txt for the license details). The software is written in the
Python programming language (http://www.python.org/) with the exception of a small amount of C
code used to optimise the code. It can be run on either Windows or Linux machines and includes a
graphical user interface to simplify the process of preparing a simulation.
