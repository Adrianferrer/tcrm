    "# Radial profiles for tropical cyclones\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the range of possible radial profiles for tropical cyclones available in TCRM. \n",
    "\n",
    "The radial profile is a parameterisation of the change in wind speed as a function of the radial distance from the eye of the cyclone. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook allows users to interact with the paramters that control the form of the radial profile, to gain an understanding of the influence the choice of this component may have on resulting hazard assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "TC models have used radial profiles in an effort to find a convenient way to represent the *gradient-level vortex* of a TC, given a limited number of parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly referenced profile is Holland's ([1980](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0493%281980%29108%3C1212%3AAAMOTW%3E2.0.CO%3B2)) profile, which defines the wind speed as a two-parameter formulation and is an analytic model, derived from the gradient wind equations and an assumption about the form of pressure profiles. The parameter that controls the \"peakedness\" of the profile $\\beta$ can be determined empirically from observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of subsequent researchers meade efforts to refine the Holland model by fitting variates to observations to refine the definition of the $\\beta$ parameter. Powell et al. ([2004](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR2831.1)) and Willoughby and Rahn are two such examples. The profile of Schloemer was arguably ahead of it's time, with essentially the same functional form, but with $\\beta = 1$. "
