   Hazard
      The magnitude of wind speed. 

   Return period
      The average time between exceedances of a given threshold. Compare to
      Annual Exceedance Probability

   Tropical cyclone
      A tropical cyclone is a rapidly-rotating storm system characterized by 
      a low-pressure center, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of 
      thunderstorms that produce heavy rain.


   Genesis
