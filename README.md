The *Tropical Cyclone Risk Model* (TCRM) is a computational tool developed by
Geoscience Australia (GA) for estimating the wind hazard from tropical
cyclones. The wind hazard is estimated by generating thousands of years worth
of storm tracks that are statistically similar to the historical record,
applying a parametric windfield and boundary layer model, and fitting an
extreme value distribution.
