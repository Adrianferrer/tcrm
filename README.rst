Notebooks
=========

Here exists a repo containing Jupyter Notebooks that have been used in
the development of code for TCRM.

Dependencies
------------

Some of these notebooks depend on modules in the TCRM
repository. Ensure that you have set the environment variables
correctly (see the `User
Guide <http://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/tcrm/docs/install.html#setting-the-environment>`_
for details).

External dependencies:

* corner
* emcee
* ipython
* ipywidgets
* jupyter
* lmfit
* nbconvert
* notebook
* pandas
* pymc
* statsmodels

.. warning:: Some of these notebooks may be transitioned to Python 3.x
             in the near future. This may make them incompatible with
             Python 2. We will try to flag this at the top of each
             notebook as the changes are made. Once a critical mass is
             reached that have been transitioned, we will flag those
             that have not been converted.
